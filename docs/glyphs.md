`glyph`: a "glyph" refers to a small graphical object used to represent data points visually. Glyphs can be any geometric shape such as spheres, arrows, cones, or cubes, and are typically used to represent more complex data attributes like direction, magnitude, or other scalar properties of data at specific points in a dataset.
