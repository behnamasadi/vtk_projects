To add multiple `vtkAngleWidget` instances and remove them one by one from VTK, you can follow these general steps:

1. Create and set up multiple `vtkAngleWidget` instances.
2. Store them in a container (e.g., `std::vector`).
3. Add them to your interactor/render window.
4. Remove them one by one as required.

Here's a code example to illustrate the steps:

```cpp
#include <vtkAngleWidget.h>
#include <vtkRenderWindowInteractor.h>
#include <vtkSmartPointer.h>
#include <vector>

int main() {
    vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderWindowInteractor> interactor = 
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkRenderWindowInteractor>::New();

    // Create multiple angle widgets
    std::vector<vtkSmartPointer<vtkAngleWidget>> angleWidgets;
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) { // example: create 3 angle widgets
        vtkSmartPointer<vtkAngleWidget> angleWidget = 
            vtkSmartPointer<vtkAngleWidget>::New();
        angleWidget->SetInteractor(interactor);
        angleWidgets.push_back(angleWidget);
    }

    // Now, suppose you want to remove them one by one
    for (auto& widget : angleWidgets) {
        widget->Off();  // disable the widget
    }

    // If you want to completely clear them from memory (assuming you're using vtkSmartPointer)
    angleWidgets.clear();

    return 0;
}
```

In the above code:

- Multiple `vtkAngleWidget` instances are created and stored in a `std::vector`.
- You can add as many as you need.
- The `Off()` method disables the widget's interaction, effectively removing them from the rendering/interaction process.
- Finally, if you're using `vtkSmartPointer`, you can clear the vector to release references to the widgets. Once all references are released, the objects will be deleted automatically. 

Remember to adjust the logic as per your specific use-case or requirements.
